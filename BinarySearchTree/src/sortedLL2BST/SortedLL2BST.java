Sorted Linked List to Balanced BST
4.2

Given a Singly Linked List which has data members sorted in ascending order.
 Construct a Balanced Binary Search Tree which has same data members as the given Linked List.

Examples:

Input:  Linked List 1->2->3
Output: A Balanced BST 
     2   
   /  \  
  1    3 


Input: Linked List 1->2->3->4->5->6->7
Output: A Balanced BST
        4
      /   \
     2     6
   /  \   / \
  1   3  4   7  

Input: Linked List 1->2->3->4
Output: A Balanced BST
      3   
    /  \  
   2    4 
 /
